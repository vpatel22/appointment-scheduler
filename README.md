# The appointment scheduler

This project is a very simple React application that allows you to view, add and delete some scheduled appointments (in this case, for pets at a vet's office).

## Some context

This project is heavily based off of the [React.js: Building an Interface](https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?account=103733490&forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Freact-js-building-an-interface-8551484%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url%26shareId%3DCaFXy6axSzmkDK8h17VdGw%253D%253D) LinkedIn Learning course by Ray Villalobos. Feel free to take a look at the [Github Repo](https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/react-interface-2880067) for that project as well.

This project started with the base [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) application and was heavily modified from that point. It also uses **Tailwind.css** for some custom styling.

## Differences

Currently, there are no large differences in how this application looks and functions vs the one that exists for the course. Configuration-wise, the only big difference is that we did not have to use CRACO and the other custom packages for working with Tailwind and PostCSS.

## Running this application locally

In the project directory, run the following:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will install the dependencies in the `package.json` file and then start the app in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
